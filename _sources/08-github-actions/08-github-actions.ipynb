    "\n",
    "It can be tedious, and time-consuming to have to install everything in your GitHUB actions environment. The tedious part is not too avoidable, that work has to be done somewhere, at least once. The time-consuming part can be problematic though; 1) you have to wait for it each time, 2) for open-source projects the time is \"free\" but may be capped at 2000 minutes a month (or whatever GitHUB decides it wants). Furthermore, a single workflow can only run up to 58 minutes. There are three strategies to mitigate these: 1) Pay for more time, 2) setup an external server to run your actions, and 3) streamline the actions by using Docker images that are pre-built. We only consider the last of these today, and we only partially consider how to use Docker.\n",

The idea is we run a virtual machine inside the virtual machine. Here we use a Dockerfile inside our repo, but you can also use images from Dockerhub, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to run a simple shell script inside a Docker image that is inside GitHUB actions.

We don't do those things here, and instead focus on the smallest working example we can get get.\n",
