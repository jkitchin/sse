    "A terminal is a command-line interface to your computer. In it you type commands to do things. In Windows it might be called the DOS prompt, or Powershell, or if you have the Linux Subsystem installed, it is just a terminal. On a Mac/Linux system it is also often called a terminal. Terminals usually do not have a lot of functionality compared to a \"Window/GUI\" system. In fact, you can run a terminal in systems where there is in GUI present.\n",
