# Welcome to Scientific Software Engineering

You will learn a little about writing scientific software. You won't learn everything. I assume little experience in writing software, so we start with the shell, and writing a shell script. Then we transition to writing that script in Python. After that we package the script in Python library, and learn how to make reusable code that works in scripts and Jupyter notebooks. From there we introduce some tools to improve code quality and to enable version control. We conclude with an introduction to GitHUb and automation tools.

Each of these topics is an iceberg of material, and we navigate between them. It is not possible to learn everything about each tool, and they tend to change somewhat often. Instead, we try to provide just enough to get you started in writing your own software tools.

Good luck on your journey!
